    "In this notebook, energy and power consumption data obtained from running particle physics event generation simulations using HERWIG is plotted. CPU and RAM energy and power consumption, alongside estimated CO2e emissions was tracked by CodeCarbon. The simulation complexity was varied across runs by changing the total number of events generated by HERWIG, and tracking was performed separately for the integration and generation phases of simulation. During the integration phase, the total cross section is calculated by numerically integrating the squared matrix elements over the allowed phase space of the process. In the generation phase, Herwig samples specific final states based on the probability distribution obtained in the integration phase, and then simulates parton showers, hadronisation, and hadron decays using Monte Carlo techniques."
