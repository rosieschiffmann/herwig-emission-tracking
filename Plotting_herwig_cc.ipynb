    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, energy and power consumption data obtained from running particle physics event generation simulations using HERWIG is plotted. CPU and RAM energy and power consumption, alongside estimated CO2e emissions was tracked by CodeCarbon. The simulation complexity was varied across runs by changing the total number of events generated by HERWIG, and tracking was performed separately for the integration and generation phases of simulation. During the integration phase, the total cross section is calculated by numerically integrating the squared matrix elements over the allowed phase space of the process. In the generation phase, Herwig samples specific final states based on the probability distribution obtained in the integration phase, and then simulates parton showers, hadronisation, and hadron decays using Monte Carlo techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for individual runs from CodeCarbon is stored in CSV files, that follow the naming convention YYYYMMDDType_metadata_EVENTS_JOBS.csv. YYYYMMDD represents the date that the simulations were run. Type is either Int or Gen, to represent data recorded duting the integration or generation phase respectively. EVENTS is the total number of simulated events. This variable can be changed inside the run_herwig_with_cc_loop.ipynb file. JOBS represnets the number of parallel jobs for HERWIG to use, in order to speed up computation by utilising multiple cores. Data that covers the emissions produced by the entire 10 runs as a whole can be found in CSV files YYYYMMDDType_emissions_EVENTS-JOBS.csv.\n",
