# herwig-experiements

Inside this repository, HERWIG software is used to simulate particle physics collision events, and CodeCarbon is subsequently used to track the energy consumption metrics for the HERWIG simulations. Inside run_herwig_with_cc_loop.py, CodeCarbon in run simulataneously with HERWIG to perform separate integration and generation phases of event simulation. For each number of events simulated, 2 warm-up runs were performed, where the data was discarded to ensure all subsequent energy measurements are stable ad reliable, and not influenced by cache loading/memory allocation/thermal stabilisation. After this, 8 runs of the given simulation were performed, with all energy/power/emissions metrics tracked by CodeCarbon, and saved to CSV files labelled Type_report_XXXXevt-Zruns.csv, where XXXX represents the number of events simulated per run, and Z is the total number of recorded runs. Inside Plotting_herwig_cc.ipynb, these CSV files are averaged, combined and plotted to display the variations in CPU and RAM energy and power, with respect to simulation runtime, and the number of collisison events simulated, wth integration and generation phases of HERWIG being plotted separately.The CO2e emissions data is also plotted.
